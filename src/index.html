    <h3>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h3>
    <p><span class="bol">I</span> ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything,
        even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were
        once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>

    <h4 class="chapter">I</h4>
    <p><span class="bol">O</span>nce when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called<span class="Italic"><i>True Stories from Nature</i></span>, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing
        an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>
    <div>
        <img src="img/hroznys.jpg" alt="hroznys">
    </div>

    <p><span class="bol">In</span> the book it said: <span class="Italic"> "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion".
    </span> I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</p>
    <div>
        <img src="img/klobouk.jpg" alt="klobouk">
    </div>

    <p><span class="bol">I</span> showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: <span class="Italic">"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</span> My drawing was not a picture
        of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always
        need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:</p>
    <div>
        <img src="img/slon.jpg" alt="slon">
    </div>

    <p><span class="bol red juice">The</span> grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.
        That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.<br> I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves,
        and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very
        useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.<br> If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with
        matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups.<br> I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them. Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the
        experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept.<br> I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: <span class="Italic">"That is a hat."</span>        Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased
        to have met such a sensible man. </p>

    <h4 class="chapter">II</h4>

    <p><span class="bol">So</span> I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic
        nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week. The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from
        any human habitation.<br> I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
        <span class="Italic"><>"If you please--draw me a sheep!" "What!" "Draw me a sheep!"</span> I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who
        stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
